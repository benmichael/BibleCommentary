It is generally assumed that Genesis was written by Moses, making it the first of the five books he wrote, which are referred to as the Torah or the Pentateuch.

For the most part Genesis is written using the “historical narrative” literary style, with the key exception being Genesis 1:1 - 2:3, which are written using the “poetry” literary style. This has caused much debate over the years regarding the age of the earth. As with all such debate, those on the extreme ends of the spectrum make the mistake of turning a secondary issue into a primary issue.
