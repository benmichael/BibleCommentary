# Commentary Overview

## Gloria in Excelsis Deo
The pitiful inklings of one human could never do justice to the magnificence and perfection of our Lord and Saviour, the God Almighty, the Three-in-One, Father, Jesus, and Holy Spirit. All glory and majesty be unto Him.

## A Collection of Scraps
To call this a commentary is perhaps an overstatement of the terms. I am no great Biblical Scholar, and have no ambitions for this poor scrap of notes to ever amount to anything. I fear that I may be doing a disservice to the word commentary when far more capable saints have penned far more extensive and well thought out works.

This is more a place to collect my thoughts into notes, nay scraps. If it be of use to anyone else, so much the better. And should God see fit to use these meager scraps to further His Kingdom, even by the tiniest margin, then it will be well worth it.

I welcome any suggestions, in the form of pull requests, issues, and discussions. These can be anything from minor spelling or grammar corrections, to corrections on doctrinal issues, to whole new sections. I will be very careful as to what I accept and what I donâ€™t, as I want to be as faithful to the Word of God as I can. I apologise in advance to anyone who feels that I am not seeing eye to eye on a particular point. There are many secondary issues about which Christians debate, some of which I will want to address, others of which I will put off addressing until I feel that I am sufficiently equipped to speak on the topic.

## Licence

I would, in fact, rather not have my name on the work itself, and have only included it in the licence so as to ensure that God's Word is held in the highest esteem, and that these thoughts of mine cannot be used heretically.
